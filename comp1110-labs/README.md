# COMP1110 Labs

### Before You Start

It is essential that you use streams to [enroll](https://cs.anu.edu.au/streams/) in a lab class before the end of week 1 (this should be available from Monday morning, Week 1).

### The Labs Repository

This repository is the basis for comp1110 lab exercises in 2016.   In [lab 1](src/comp1110/lab1/README.md), you will [**fork**](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/fork-project.html) your own copy of this repository and the use that forked copy for the remainder of the semester.

### Lab Exercises

Instructions for each lab are contained in this repository, within the folder
where you will be writing your Java code for the respective lab.
You can view them here:
*  [Lab 1](src/comp1110/lab1/README.md)
*  [Lab 2](src/comp1110/lab2/README.md)
*  [Lab 3](src/comp1110/lab3/README.md)
*  [Lab 4](src/comp1110/lab4/README.md)
*  [Lab 5](src/comp1110/lab5/README.md)
*  [Lab 6](src/comp1110/lab6/README.md)
*  [Lab 7](src/comp1110/lab7/README.md)

### Lab Tests

You will sit in-lab exams in [weeks 3 and 7](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110/wikis/schedule).  You will *not* use *this repository* to complete those exams.   Instead, you will create your own repositories as part of the test.   When you sit the test, you will find instructions on the desktop of the computer when you log in.   You can prepare for the lab tests by working through the questions at the links below.   Your lab test will include a randomized selection of the questions found in the pages below:

*  [Lab test 1](labtest1/README.md)
*  [Lab test 2](labtest2/README.md)
